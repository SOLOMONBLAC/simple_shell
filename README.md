#ALX SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
#PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The Alx simple shell project is designed for learners to demonstrate the skill they have learnt in shell basics and C programming. The project is also curated to enhance learning and mastering of skill already learned that produces confidence in the students ability to be ready for job market. The requirement as detailed in the project are as follows;
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
Who is Ken Thompson
How does a shell work
What is a pid and a ppid
How to manipulate the environment of the current process
What is the difference between a function and a system call
How to create processes
What are the three prototypes of main

How to execute another program with the execve system call
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
